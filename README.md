# ESP-NOW Car Project

## Steps to Make the Car Run

1. **Build the chassis** and assemble the motors and wheels.
2. **Connect the receiver ESP32 board** to the Arduino and upload the MAC address retrieval code.
3. **Follow the detailed steps** provided in the attached document for MAC address retrieval.
4. **Make the necessary connections** for both the receiver and transmitter as per the circuit diagram.
5. **Upload the receiver code** to the receiver ESP32 board.
6. **Upload the transmitter code** to the transmitter ESP32 board.
7. **Enter the retrieved MAC address** in the transmitter code.
8. **Provide power to the circuit.** Any power source between 7V-12V can be used, no need to follow the exact adapter shown in the diagram.
9. **Test and run the car.**
